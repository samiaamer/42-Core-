ðŸ’» Core Projects
After completing the Piscine, students enter the Core phase, which consists of the Common Core curriculum. This curriculum is built around projects that cover different languages, concepts, and disciplines. It includes a range of projects, such as:

Algorithm Design: Projects like libft, get_next_line, and push_swap help develop strong problem-solving and algorithm skills.
System Programming: Projects like minitalk, so_long, and philosophers dive deep into low-level programming, focusing on processes, threads, memory management, and inter-process communication.
Advanced Topics: More challenging projects such as cub3d, webserv, and minishell allow students to explore advanced topics like multithreading, network programming, and web development.
The Common Core curriculum is designed to ensure that every student becomes a well-rounded software developer, equipped with the skills needed to build real-world applications.
